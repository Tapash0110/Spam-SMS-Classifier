This model contains a machine learning pipeline for text classification tasks using **Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB)**. It includes custom text preprocessing, feature extraction with TF-IDF, and model evaluation.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Custom text preprocessing (removal of punctuation and stopwords)
- Bag-of-Words (BoW) vectorization
- TF-IDF transformation
- Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier
- Model evaluation and visualization (e.g., confusion matrices)
